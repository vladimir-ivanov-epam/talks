# About me

* Vladimir Ivanov - Lead Software Engineer
* Primary Skill: Android
* React Native Experience > 2 year
* SA on several prod& non-prod projects

---

# Let's get to know each other!

---

# Project roles

* Software engineers
* QA Engineers
* Project manager
* Product owner
* BA
* ???

---

# Software engineer

* implements user-stories
* obtained from BA

--- 

# Where does BA get the stories?

---

# He/She collects the requirements from the customer

---

# Functional requirements!

* The system should allow an administrator to login
* The system should show the list of users

---

# Non-functional requirements

* The application should use TLS 1.2 for all connections involving user-data
* The application should open the page under 0.5 second
* The application should be available 23 hours per day 


--- 

# Constraints

* The app should be deployed to customers' Azure cloud
* The app should implement 152 federal law

---

# Requirements are:

* Functional
* Non-functional
* Constraints

---

# Some of them will change the architecture of the solution.

For example, the change of availability from 95% to 99% changes half of the architecture.


---

# Source of requirements

* Stakeholders

---

Stakeholders are the people who have an interest in the project

* Customer business representatives
* Delivery organization business representatives
* Technical folks from both sides
* End-users
* Competitors

---

## In order to gather requirements you need to talk to stakeholders. 

## The stakeholders identification is a first responsibility of a Solution Architect.

# Whatâ€™s an architecture? 

The set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. [^2]

# What the hell it means? 

* Architecture is a key to the system properties, an end user is concerned about
* Or product owner thinks so
* There are no bad or good architectures; there are ones that fit the target system properties

---

# Why bother in a first place?

---

# Why bother in a first place?

* Because developing a product costs money.
* Thinking beforehand costs much less.

How to document architecture? 

* Non-formal notations
* Semi-formal notations
* Formal notations

---

# Non-formal notations

* Custom notation
* Requires legend 
* No formal validation possible

---


# Non-formal notations

* Accepted notation
* Still no formal validation possible

---

# Formal notations

* Strict rules
* Formal validation

---

# So...

The person who gather requirements, conducts requirement workshops, identifies ASR and build the architecture is called Solution Architect.

---

# In EPAM

Solution Architect:

* Practical experience with 10+ projects in relevant engineering domain.

* Good knowledge of architectural theory out of primary technology domain context bounds.

* Ability to identify stakeholders and adopt communication style to particular role (effectively communicate with peer client architects and management).
